        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These moist banana chocolate chip muffins are easy to make whenever you have some ripe bananas. They're my kids' favorite homemade treat — they love to see who gets the most chocolate chips in a muffin!<br> "The right muffin can save your day. It can pull you out of a hungry slump or provide a good jolt of sugar and nutrients in the morning." <br> If you’re looking for something that twists a classic, this recipe for banana chocolate chip muffins does just that. The recipe includes plain yogurt and bananas, so the result will be a soft muffin with great moisture. Banana muffins taste similar to banana bread—and very ripe bananas, like banana bread, will work best for this recipe.
