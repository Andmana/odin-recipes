    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix oil, yogurt, egg, and vanilla together in a separate bowl until well combined; stir into flour mixture until smooth. Gently fold in mashed bananas and chocolate chips. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 22 to 25 minutes. Cool briefly in the tin, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
